        <h2>Who are we? What is this website, and what is its purpose?</h2>
        <p> Codeureka was created by Mihir Malik, Kanav Singh, Ra Sehrawat, and Shaun Kumar. At Pathways School Gurgaon, we have been introduced to a program called the Enrichment Cluster Program wherein we delve into fields of work that we enjoy. Our group, chose the cluster of Web Development and took this wonderous opportunity to create a website that can help you and others take your first steps to becoming a professional coder.</p>
